BOARD STATE

  Hybrid approach: Piece list for move generation with separate board square representation for lookups.  

DATA STRUCTURE

  Directed Acyclic Graph
    Position object used as node in search tree
    Evaluation score stored in node
    edges to other nodes generated based on move list.

SEARCHING / TRAVERSAL ----

  Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
    =>  MTD(f) for scope narrowing (optional)
        =>  Alpha-Beta Pruning with memoization
            =>  Transposition hash table for memoization

EVALUATION ----

  Weighted pattern matching

Current Issues ----

  Minimax and Negamax performance should be very similar.  Instead:
  # Alphabeta:
    # 3 ply => 0.04 seconds, 462 nodes
    # 4 ply => 0.08 seconds, 488 nodes
    # 5 ply => 1.07 seconds, 10,089 nodes
    # 6 ply => 2.25 seconds, 12,284 nodes
    # 7 ply => 111.56 seconds, 260,354 nodes ... ???
  # W/ Negamax:
    # 3 ply => .15 seconds, 562 nodes
    # 4 ply => .89 seconds, 1,440 nodes
    # 5 ply => 82.33 seconds, 52,494 nodes ... ???


  AI does not always select obvious best moves - does not always capture expensive units except via pawns.

To Do ----

  Refactor Move Generation:

    - Location class could serve as key in piece list hashes.



  Add separate PSTs for early- and late-game.
  Handle king_in_check? in board object
  Add Killer Heuristic to move ordering.
  Allow incremental calculation of hash values based on previous move of the Transposition Table.
