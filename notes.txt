BOARD STATE

  Hybrid approach: Piece list for move generation with separate board square representation for lookups.  

DATA STRUCTURE

  Directed Acyclic Graph
    Position object passed to node generator.
    Evaluation score stored in node
    edges to other nodes generated based on move list.

SEARCHING / TRAVERSAL ----

  Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
    =>  MTD(f) for scope narrowing
        =>  Alpha-Beta Pruning with memoization
            =>  Transposition hash table for memoization

EVALUATION ----

  Weighted pattern matching


Current Issues ----

  passing Board and Piece List from one node to another would require deep copy.
    - if there were some way of passing reference byval such that changes would not effect calling scope, that would 
      be much more efficient

  passing the Board Rep only (byval) would require generating a new piece list based on Board prior to each evaluation - even more wasteful than deep copy.

  would be more efficient to deep copy piece list only, then generate board from piece list.  But still woefully inefficient.
