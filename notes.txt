BOARD STATE

  Hybrid approach: Piece list for move generation with separate board square representation for lookups.  

DATA STRUCTURE

  Directed Acyclic Graph
    Position object passed to node generator.
    Evaluation score stored in node
    edges to other nodes generated based on move list.

SEARCHING / TRAVERSAL ----

  Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
    =>  MTD(f) for scope narrowing (optional)
        =>  Alpha-Beta Pruning with memoization
            =>  Transposition hash table for memoization

EVALUATION ----

  Weighted pattern matching

Current Issues ----

  Need to account for castling, half-move clock, turn limit.

  create a hash within Position.pieces allowing pieces to be looked up by location


To Do ----

  add move! method to position object.
