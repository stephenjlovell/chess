BOARD STATE
  Hybrid approach: Piece list for move generation with separate board square representation for lookups.  
GAME TREE
  Position object used as node in search tree
  Evaluation score stored in node
  edges to other nodes generated based on move list.
SEARCHING / TRAVERSAL ----
  Iterative Deepening
    =>  MTD(f) for scope narrowing
        =>  Alpha-Beta Pruning with memoization
            =>  Transposition hash table for memoization
EVALUATION ----
  Material balance
  Mobility balance
  Piece Square Tables

To Do ----

  Add separate PSTs for early- and late-game.

  Add Killer Heuristic to move ordering.
  Allow incremental calculation of hash values based on previous move of the Transposition Table.

  Principal Variation - 


  Explore adding search extensions to "interesting" branches:
    -checks
    -moves with MVV-LVA ratio greater than 2
    -pawn promotions

  If capture or pawn move, reset halfmove_clock.  If any other move, increment halfmove_clock by 1.
