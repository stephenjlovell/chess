Bitboards needed for board representation:

  2 x 6 bitboards for piece type/color
  1 bitboard for occupancy (includes both colors)



Bitboard move generation:
  7 x 64 bitboards showing where each square can be attacked from by each piece type (given a blank board).  

  Mask occupancy bb with each ray direction for square.  For NW, N, NE, E directions, use bitscan forward (lsb)
  to get first blocker.  For SE, S, SW, W directions, use bitscan reverse (msb) to get first blocker


Additional bitboards needed:

  Attack maps:


  # 4. 64 x 64 array of bitboards indicating the squares 'in between' each pair of squares, for generating check evasions.
